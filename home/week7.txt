1. MVC pattern, binarySearch, Complexity of Algorithm
    implement merge sort algorithm(first see visualization then write code)
    http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html

2. Do all unfinished tasks

3. Implement class FileHelper
       - find file(dir)
       - show directoryContent

       - delete file or dir
       - copy file

       - deepFind (do search in file name and in file content by keyword)
           * result of search can be written into file

       -* find in file system without recursion

           video - 70%
           audio - 10%
           document - 5%
