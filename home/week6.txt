1.
    Generics

    Exceptions(Checked, Unchecked) hierarchy
    throw, throws, try-catch-finally

    design patterns(Decorator, Adapter)

            java.io.*
               File

    InputStream  OutputStream
    Reader       Writer

    Scanner      PrintWriter

    Serialization(Serializable, ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream)

    Cloning in Java
    try methods in class Arrays

    I recommend you to read Head First Design Patterns

2. Add possibility to ServiceCentre save info after exit program, and load data when application starts

     a) save using Serialization


     b) save using PrintWriter and load by Scanner

        example of file

        1,Client,Oleg,23,1200
        2,Directir,Vania,40,10000

        If you want you can change save format in file

3. Rewrite Queue(previous homework)
    add Generics, Iterator

4*. Recursion, do max tasks, debug all task, see how works methods stack
